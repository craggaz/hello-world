hello friends

craggaz here, i have had an interest in code and design for a long time but never found the backbone to sit down and learn it. I would like to learn how to code and hopfully make some cool new friends along the way.

I would like to learn python and a few other simple languages to start with.

this github wil be used for me to learn how to code and for others to be able to curate my code and give me tips and tricks for learning.

I would like to eventually be able to read and write code for research purposes. i also have an interest in bug bounties(who doesnt) these days.


package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, M9")
	
	fmt.Println("WeLcUm, Teh the hells")
	
	fmt.Println("your PC, is M9 LEL LEL NjoY")
}
